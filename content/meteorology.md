**Virtual Temperature T<sub>v</sub>** is the temperature at which dry air would have the same density as the moist air, at a given pressure.\
$T_v = T (1+0.61r)$,\
where r is mising ratio in units g/g.

**Convective inihibition (CIN)**: the energy required to overcome a stable layer in the atmosphere that prevents an air parcel from rising freely to its level of free convection (LFC).

**Convective Available Potential Energy (CPAE)**: a measure of the instability of the atmosphere and the energy available to fuel thunderstorms.
