# Welcome to My Website
I'm Simon Tin. I'm a Bechelor graduate in Earth System Science in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, mainly focusing on meteorology. I'm being a computational scientist working on the CPAS team. CPAS is an atmospheric simulation platform modulated from MPAS and WRF. My recent job roles is to work on CPAS operational daily run, and cooperate with CUHK to do future projection on precipitation climatology.
